HIGU - A tag oriented image organizer with a JSON web interface

PREREQS:

  To function properly HIGU requires Python 2.6 or higher to be installed on
  the machine and in the machine's PATH. Furthermore the following python
  libraries must be installed and in the PYTHONPATH:

  * SQLAlchemy (tested with version 0.5.8)
  * CherryPy (tested with version 3.1.2)
  * PIL or Pillow (tested with version 1.1.7)

INSTALLATION:

  (1) Extract or checkout the entire HIGU tree into a directory

  (2) Run the script 'run_tests.sh' to ensure that the checked out version of
      higu runs in your environment

  (3) Make a copy of the configuration file 'test.cfg' into the same directory
      and name it whatever you want. For the sake of these instructions we
      will assume you named it 'site.cfg'.

  (4) Open 'site.cfg' and change the library path. We recommend you use an
      absolute path instead of a relative path. Read the comments and change
      the other settings as you see fit.

  (5) Symlink start.test.sh and addto.test.sh to start.site.sh and
      addto.site.sh (or whatever you named your cfg).

  (6) Run start.site.sh to start the http web-server

  (7) Use the addto.site.sh script to add images to your library

  (8) Enjoy!
